			"taskTitle": "Develop Discord Webhook Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for event detection, embed construction, webhook delivery, rate limiting, and settings toggle.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused integration task with clear boundaries: event handling, message formatting, webhook delivery, and rate limiting. Complexity is moderate due to external API and rate limiting logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize MVP: End-to-End Testing, Documentation, and Observability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the MVP finalization into subtasks for e2e testing, documentation writing, deploy guide, observability hooks, security checks, and team walkthrough.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers multiple disciplines: testing, documentation, observability, and security. Coordination and thoroughness are required, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Enhanced Proxy Management, Rate Limiting, and Monitoring for Scraper",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into subtasks for proxy integration, rotation logic, rate limiting, monitoring, metrics storage, dashboard/API, Cloudflare Browser Rendering fallback, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex task involving advanced proxy management, dynamic rate limiting, real-time monitoring, fallback mechanisms, and robust error handling. It touches multiple system layers and requires careful design to ensure reliability and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ListPageExtractor Service for Texas Gun Trader",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ListPageExtractor into subtasks such as: (1) defining the Listing schema, (2) selecting and integrating the HTML parsing library, (3) implementing extraction logic for each field (title, price, URL, thumbnail), (4) handling edge cases (missing images/prices), and (5) writing documentation and automated tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard web scraping and data extraction using established libraries, with moderate complexity due to handling edge cases and ensuring maintainability. The logic is straightforward but requires careful handling of variations in HTML structure and robust testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement DetailPageExtractor Service for Texas Gun Trader",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the DetailPageExtractor implementation into subtasks such as: (1) defining the detailed listing schema, (2) integrating the HTML parser and network request logic, (3) extracting each data field (description, images, specs, seller info, condition), (4) handling missing/malformed data, (5) implementing retry and rate limiting logic, and (6) writing comprehensive tests and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is more complex due to the need to extract a wide range of fields, handle network operations, and ensure resilience to page structure changes. It requires robust error handling and schema design, increasing both implementation and testing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PaginationHandler Service for Texas Gun Trader",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the PaginationHandler into subtasks such as: (1) analyzing pagination patterns in sample HTML, (2) implementing logic to detect and parse pagination controls, (3) generating navigation URLs or actions, (4) handling edge cases (single page, missing controls), and (5) writing tests for various pagination scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Pagination handling requires careful parsing of navigation elements and robust logic to handle edge cases and changes in page structure. While not algorithmically complex, it demands thorough testing and error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor ScraperService for Two-Phase Extraction Orchestration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the ScraperService refactor into subtasks such as: (1) designing the orchestration workflow, (2) integrating ListPageExtractor and PaginationHandler, (3) collecting and queuing listing URLs, (4) integrating DetailPageExtractor, (5) implementing rate limiting and concurrency controls, (6) adding error handling and retry logic, and (7) implementing progress tracking and resumability.",
			"reasoning": "This orchestration task is complex due to coordination between multiple services, concurrency management, error handling, and progress tracking. It requires architectural changes and robust integration testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Job Queue System for Detail Page Extraction",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the job queue system implementation into subtasks such as: (1) selecting and setting up the queue technology, (2) designing the job schema and status tracking, (3) implementing enqueue and dequeue logic, (4) adding retry and resume capabilities, (5) integrating monitoring and logging, and (6) providing an API/interface for job management.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a robust job queue with persistence, retries, monitoring, and resume capability involves significant architectural and operational complexity, especially for reliability and scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Admin Dashboard for Two-Phase Monitoring and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the admin dashboard enhancement into subtasks such as: (1) designing the UI for phase separation, (2) implementing real-time progress tracking for both phases, (3) building testing interfaces for list/detail extraction, (4) integrating extraction statistics and success rates, (5) adding debugging tools (logs, failed sample inspection), (6) connecting to backend services for data aggregation, and (7) performing usability testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires significant UI/UX design, real-time data integration, and robust testing tools, making it complex both on the frontend and backend integration sides."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update Database Schema and Data Flow for Two-Phase Processing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the database and data flow update into subtasks such as: (1) designing the new schema with phase/status fields, (2) implementing migration scripts, (3) updating data access logic for two-phase updates, (4) ensuring atomic updates and race condition prevention, and (5) updating documentation and data flow diagrams.",
			"reasoning": "Schema changes and data flow updates are moderately complex, requiring careful design for status tracking, atomicity, and efficient querying, but are well-bounded with standard database practices."
